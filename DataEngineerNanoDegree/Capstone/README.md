## **Project: Capstone**
The purpose of this project is to process Covid-19 data in an attempt to analyze & visualize the data to derive statistical information & study patterns in Covid cases in the USA & worldwide.

The project is geared towards offering the following two features - 

1. The ability to run DSL (Domain Specific Language) Query on Elasticsearch

2. Kibana Dashboard visualization 

With the two features mentioned above, the project aims at serving two sections of the audience. 

1. Since Elasticsearch has the ability to store significantly large amounts of data, it can serve Data Scientists as a source and/or target for the data they need to train Machine Learning models.

2. The powerful dashboarding feature offers Data Analysts the ability to create intuitive & descriptive visuals to study & analyze patterns associated with the available datapoints.

### **Data**
***
The data is obtained from two distinct sources.

* Source 1: **`Covid19API`** - **https://covid19api.com**
    
    We particularly hit two endpoints - 
    
    1. **https://api.covid19api.com/countries** - This endpoint returns a list of all countries for which covid data is available
    
    2. **https://api.covid19api.com/dayone/country/country-name** - This endpoint returns covid data for the given country.

### <b>ETL Architecture</b>
***

This model leverages Python & Pandas to read, clean, transform & load data to the target location. 

The data from both sources comprises of approximately 1.2 Million records/rows. 

Pandas offers an efficient way to handle such large amounts of data through its DataFrame API.

One may argue that Spark Dataframes can offer more processing speed than Pandas. 

While that may be true, 1.2 Million records/rows is still an amount that is efficiently manageable by Pandas.

The target location for the data is an Elasticsearch domain. 

Having an Elasticsearch domain achieves several goals. 

    1. Elasticsearch is a NoSQL Database. Which means we do not have to worry about maintaining a schema. 
       Especially when it comes to data that is sourced from several places and is readily available 'out-of-the-box',
       we need a storage that accomodates variable schema. 
    2. Elasticsearch also offers massive scalability which should easily accommodate future data surges.
    3. Elasticsearch offers a seamless integration with Kibana, which makes analyzing & visualizing the data significantly easy.

### <b>ETL Process</b>
***

**Covid Cases by Country**

    1. Run covid_cases_by_country.py
    2. The script hits the endpoint https://api.covid19api.com/countries & gets all the available countries
    3. The script iterates over the list of countries and gets all the covid data for each available day by hitting 
    the https://api.covid19api.com/dayone/country/country-name endpoint
    4. The data is then posted to an Elasticsearch index using the Bulk API
     
**Covid Cases in USA by County**

    1. Run covid_cases_usa.py
    2. The script gathers all the data files under the covid_county_data folder
    3. Each file is read into a Pandas Dataframe and all Dataframes are concatenated into a single Dataframe 
       based on the file type
    4. The concatenated dataframes are then joined with another dataframe which carries the county population data
    5. The merged dataframes are then posted to an Elasticsearch index using thr Bulk API.
    
    
### **Elasticsearch Setup**
***

For this project, an Elasticsearch Domain was provisioned from the AWS Management Console.

Instance type used - **m5.large.elasticsearch**

The domain was allowed open access from all traffic. Ideally though, a fine-grained access policy should be assigned to the domain & the domain should be placed inside a VPC.

Following is the Elasticsearch access policy - 

    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Sid": "es_ip_access",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "AWS": "*"
          },
          "Action": "es:*",
          "Resource": "arn:aws:es:us-west-2:xxxxxxxxxxxx:domain/my-elasticsearch-domain/*",
          "Condition": {
            "IpAddress": {
              "aws:SourceIp": [
                "0.0.0.0/0"
              ]
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    
### Handling Edge Cases
***

The project works fine under ideal conditions, but we also need to be geared up to handle non-ideal edge cases.

1. What if the data increased by 100x?

    Here, we need to think of two aspects - `Processing` & `Storage`.
    
    **`Processing`** - 
    
    Handling massive amounts of data can take a toll on your local machine.
    In that case, We can look at a few different alternatives to run the same code more efficiently.
    1. We can build a Docker Image and run our scripts inside a container of that image.
    2. We can also provision an EC2 instance with a compute-optimized class and run our scripts on that instance.
    3. If we still need more compute power, we can leverage Spark Dataframes to reduce our processing time.
    4. Any of the above solutions can be further "scaled out" in the form of a cluster deployment. 
    For example - A Kubernetes cluster with Docker containers or an EMR Spark-based cluster, etc.
    
    The above mentioned solutions can prove to be significantly more costly. So we need to carefully design
    the infrastructure in a way that is optimal, both processing speed-wise & cost-wise. 
    A careful consideration towards running the instances on a fixed schedule, terminating/creating instances as needed or utiliizng Spot instances 
    can help us achieve an optimal pipeline.
    
    **`Storage`** -
    
    As mentioned in the architecture above, Elasticsearch is a NoSQL database that offers massive scalable storage capacity.
    To handle significantly larger data, we can use larger instances and also scale out the Elasticsearch cluster to include more number of Master & Worker nodes as needed. 

2. The pipelines would be run on a daily basis by 7 am every day.
    
    This is easily achievable by having some sort of schedule that triggers the pipeline.
    For example, an EC2-based pipeline can be triggered using a Lambda that runs on a Cron Schedule.
    Airflow too offers a @daily schedule_interval as a feature to trigger the pipeline daily.
    
3. The database needed to be accessed by 100+ people.

    One way to achieve this could be to have an open Elasticsearch endpoint which can be accessed by virtually everyone.
    But, that is definitely not the most appropriate way to go about this requirement.
    Having an open access Elasticsearch straightaway puts the domain at a high risk of security vulnerability.
    
    The right way would include two aspects - 
    1. A solution that offers high availability so that several people can access the data concurrently.
    2. Also, the data store should be secure.
    
    The above two aspects can be achieved using a combination of Web servers (could be EC2 based), Auto Scaling Groups (ASG), AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) & Route53.
    
    We can setup a Route53 policy that is latency or geolocation based. This would route the traffic to the ALB in a way that offers minimal response time to users.
    
    The ALB pointing towards the Web Servers has the ability to intelligently balance the load owing to the incoming traffic.
    
    Having the servers inside an ASG would ensure that all servers have a regular health check. If any server fails a health check, the ASG decomissiones the server and replaces it with a new one.
    This makes sure that the users do not experience any undesired latency in accessing the data. 
    
    Placing all of the resources mentioned above inside a VPC with fine-grained Security Groups &
    Access Control Lists would ensure that the setup is as secure as possible.
